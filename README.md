# 📊 **AI Customer Churn Prediction System**  
A Machine-Learning Powered Web Application for Real-Time Churn Risk Analysis

---

## 🚀 **Introduction**
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges facing modern businesses. Losing customers directly impacts revenue, increases acquisition costs, and reduces long-term business stability.  
To address this challenge, the **AI Customer Churn Prediction System** leverages machine learning and behavioral analytics to estimate the likelihood that a customer will leave (churn) and provides actionable insights to help businesses proactively retain customers.

This project implements a fully interactive **Streamlit web application**, powered by a trained **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification model, supported by feature scaling and categorical encoding for highly accurate real-time predictions.

## ❗ **Problem Overview**
Businesses struggle to answer key questions:

- **Which customers are most likely to leave?**  
- **Why are they leaving?**  
- **What actions can prevent churn?**  
- **How can we detect churn early—before it's too late?**

Traditional systems rely on manual review and basic statistics, which are slow, inconsistent, and reactive.

As customer bases scale, this approach becomes ineffective.  
Thus, identifying churn early using **AI-driven predictive analytics** becomes essential.
